FLOW: INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
1. Store of new data 
	*- Validations: Existing name (to prevent multiple records), Negative values (can only accept positive values which means the stock first
		before it gets used
	*- Every new data, inventory history data will be created (FK) 
	*- uc:first before storing the data
2. For updating info
    *- Can only change name (use the validations of existing name)
    *- uc:first before storing the data
3. for updating amount
    *- Will enter new inventory history data with parameters (id, inventory_id, type, amount, date)
    *- Helper 1: be able to check if the current stocks is > incoming decrement stocks 
    	> the helper must check the type of the inventory history data entry (increment, decrement)
    	> if current stocks > incoming decrement = subtract else, return false validation
    *- Helper 2: be able to check the status of the product, if the total_amount after the computation
    	is 0, status should be false or unavailable else status should be true or available


SALES:
1. Store of new data
	*- 3 input fields : Amount, Type (Either net gross or net income), Date
		> Validation wherein only 1 month in 1 year per sales
	*- System can display total amount of sales 
	- System can compare the profit between months (ex. last month and this current month) in percentage
		> 2 inputs (1st month and 2nd month)
		> divide by 100 each month (ex. 2000
